    <h1>Say NO to Violence</h1>
    <p>Say no to violence. It harms individuals, families, and communities, perpetuating pain and fear. Embrace peace, understanding, and respect in all interactions. Violence only fuels hatred, while kindness fosters unity. Choose dialogue over aggression, compassion over cruelty, and together, we can build a safer, more harmonious world.</p>
